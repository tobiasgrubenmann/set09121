# Review - Activity Diagrams

- Activity diagrams allow us to model the flow through the application from a high-level.
    - Menu screens.
    - Internal system interactions.
- The goal is to be able to create a skeleton of the functionality before implementing it.

# Review - AI Techniques

- There are numerous usable AI techniques applicable to games development.
    - Classical, deterministic techniques - popular.
    - Academic, non-deterministic techniques - useful in some areas.
- Different techniques accomplish different aspects of game behaviour.
    - Movement.
    - Decision making.
    - Strategy.
    - Learning.
- Today we will look at the encoding decisions using decision tree techniques.

# Review - State Machines

- State machines (or specifically in our case Finite State Machines - FSM) are one of the most fundamental concepts and cornerstones of computer science.
- A state machine is a technique of describing and modelling the state (e.g. behaviour, control, etc.) of a system in a mathematical manner.
- The system is modelled with a number of states and the transitions between these states.
    - The idea of a graph of states can come into play here - remember our description of a graph last week.

# Review - State Machines


- Let us return to the guard concept we presented last week.
- We will take a simple view so we can just focus on state.
- The guard has some basic actions:
    - The guard patrols between point A and point B.
    - If the guard is shot at, the guard will stop patrolling, engage the player, and fire back.
    - If the guard loses sight of the player, the guard will return to patrolling between point A and point B.
    - If the guard is hit, the guard will fall onto the ground and die.

## Decision Trees

# What are Decision Trees?

- Decision trees provide us with an approach to modelling a decision.
- The decision structure is formed into a tree.
    - We traverse different branches based on the decision we wish to make.
- The decision to go down a branch can be determined by:
    - The current state of the game. (E.g., testing some value)
    - Randomly, by drawing a value from a distribution.
- At the end of a branch, a decision is made, and therefore an action is undertaken.


---

# Decision Tree - Example 1

- The sophisticated guard.
- The guard has some basic actions.
    - The guard patrols between point A and point B.
    - The guard has a 20% chance of stopping while patrolling.
    - If the guard is shot at, the guard will stop patrolling, engage with the player, and fire back.
    - If the guard sees the player, they will engage the player.
    - If the guard loses sight of the player, the guard will return to patrolling between point A and point B.

# Decision Tree - Diagram

# Diagram Explanation

- A decision tree is made up of a number of nodes.
    - Nodes &rarr; decision points, edges &rarr; results
- And a number of transitions.
	- A transition has a condition associated with it, e.g. 80%
- We traverse the tree, starting at the root node, making decisions based on information, before arriving at a leaf.

---

# Using Activity Diagrams

- We have previously seen state diagrams used for modelling state machines.
- We can undertake a similar approach with activity diagrams for decision trees.
- Activity diagrams provide us with guarded transitions (edges)
    - The "guard" is simply a decision.
- Activity diagrams also provide a choice or branch symbol (nodes)
- If you want, you can use the action states as the actual actions to take.

# Decision Trees in Our Game Engine

- Our aim is to implement basic, reusable decision tree behaviour within our engine.
    - We want reusable so that is is simple for us to extend functionality if required.
- We will be using a tree-like data structure to implement the decision tree behaviour.
- Each decision point will be tested to determine which path to follow. The end decision will result in an action.

# `DecisionTreeNode` Interface

- Defines only one method.
    - `makeDecision`
- `makeDecision` is called by the `entity` which in turn calls `makeDecision` on any child nodes.

---

# Implementing Nodes

- `Decision` and `MultiDecision` implement the `DecisionTreeNode` interface.
- Their `makeDecision` method will call the `makeDecision` on one of the child nodes returned by `getBranch`.
- `getBranch` is defined by the programmer based on required parameters.

---

# Using the Class

- We can make a random decision class implementation just by extending the decision class.
- On the `getBranch` code we just generate a random number and use it to determine the action to.

```cpp
bool nextChoice = rand() == 0 ? true : false;
if (nextChoice)
    return trueNode;
else
    return falseNode;
```


---

# Diagram to Implementation

```cpp
decisionTree = make_shared<PlayerVisibleDecision>( 
    make_shared<EngageDecision>(), 
    make_shared<ChanceDecision>( 
        0.8f, make_shared<PatrolDecision>(),
         0.2f, 
         make_shared<WaitDecision>())
    );
```

## Combining Decision Trees and State Machines


---

# Combining State Machines and Decision Trees

- We can combine state machines and decision trees to create a more complex AI behaviour.
- Decision trees are used to make decisions.
- State machines are used to perform the actions made by decisions.
- This is a powerful technique, and it is what we will do in the practical.
    - Steering behaviours can then be merged into the states to allow stateful movement based on decisions.

# Comments on Decision Trees
- Decision trees are very useful when you want to map a complex decision.
    - Granted, these are just nested if statements, but those can get messy.
- Decision trees can be reused easily enough.
- Decision trees can get quite complex however.
    - The deeper the tree, the longer it will take to make a decision.
- We are also using a number of virtual function calls to implement the tree.
    - Remember, virtual function calls are more expensive than normal function calls.

## Summary

# Summary

- Decision trees are a useful diagrammatic technique and algorithm to create AI that can make decisions.
    - We still need to determine the decisions to program though.
- We can work with activity diagrams to model our decision trees.
- We can also combine decision trees and state machines to create more complex data.
